Network Message Bus
====================

msg type : ip addr + port no

interface:
* msgget_nmb
* msgsnd_nmb
* msgrcv_nmb

-> driver uses nmb interface to send a message to other systems
-> msgsnd_nmb actually sends the message to a local server using TCP on port 1111
-> the local server then broadcasts this message to other systems on port 1112
-> the local server that recives only the messages that are meant for it
-> the local server that recives a message stores it until the process is ready to recieve it (i.e comes online)

=> non-blocking system


Steps:

1. Make a non-blocking driver using normal message queues
2. Implement TCPSocket to send message to local server
3. Implement UDPSocket to broadcast messages
4. Implement receiving mechanism on UDPSocket ( this is where it might get tricky )
5. Sleep
